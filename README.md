# A example React project that calls a local web API

This is a starter project that illustrates React components consuming a web API.


## Steps

To experience this repo in all of its glory:

* Clone this repo

```sh
cd react-to-web-api
npm install
npm run dev
```

* Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Exercise options

* Understand where and how each component is being used (you will find some code you can reuse. Remember DRY!)

  - Make small changes to confirm your hypotheses
  - Reset all changes you've made since last commit with `git checkout .`

* The database can be updated by many users. Simulate this by making a 'refresh button'. You may have seen some functionality do something similar already. Open a second browser tab and make a new record for the list. Then, click your refresh button on your original tab and see if your component renders the new entry you created.  
Example steps you may take to complete this task: 

  - [ ] 1. Build the button and get it to log something when you click it
  - [ ] 2. Get the click to send a GET request to your API, and get the server to log something to show that the request has been made sucessfully
  - [ ] 3. Get the server to respond with the list of current records/widgets.
  - [ ] 4. Get the client-side to receive the response from the server, and update the client-side state so you can now see all the new records

* Extend the details that are stored in widgets - add a `rating` field to what is displayed and on the add form

* Add the ability to delete a widget

* Add the ability to update a widget

  - [ ] 1. Build the button and get it to log something when you click it
  - [ ] 2. Get the click to send something to your API, and get the server to prove it received something
  - [ ] 3. Get the server to save something sent with click. Find a way to check something was save to the 'database' (remember we're only storing the database in memory in this exercise)
  - [ ] 4. Get the server to send a message back to the user, and kick off some update of the user interface (you might want to force it to get all items again, like in the _refresh button_ case)

* Add more components and write tests for them in `test` (the tests can be run with `npm test`)


## CORS

When using `npm start` and `npm run dev`, the client is served from the same the port as the API. In this scenario we don't run into the limitations of CORS (cross-origin resource sharing). However, if we want to expose our API to clients hosted at different domain names and/or ports, we must enable this by configuring our CORS configuration.

To experience the effects of CORS:

* Run `npm run dev:server` in one terminal to expose the API on port 3000.
* Run `npm run webpack:server` in a different terminal to serve the client on port 8080.
* Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and the site should continue to work fine.
* Have a look at how the Express middleware uses the `cors` package in `server/server.js`. Try commenting out that line and restarting `npm start`. Refresh the app and you should see errors. Read more about how to configure the [`cors` package](https://npmjs.org/package/cors) and try different configurations.
